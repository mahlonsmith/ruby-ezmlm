== Installation

=== Requirements

Ruby-Ezmlm is tested using Ruby 1.8.6:

  * Ruby (>= 1.8.6): http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

Other versions may work, but are not tested.

=== Ruby Modules

There are two ways you can install Ruby-Ezmlm. The easiest is to use RubyGems:

  $ sudo gem install -y ruby-ezmlm

If you'd rather install from source, you'll need these:

  * Tmail (>= 1.2.3.1): http://tmail.rubyforge.org/

Once these are installed:

  $ tar -zxvf ezmlm-0.0.1.tgz
  $ cd thingfish-0.0.1
  $ su -
  # rake install

If you want to help out with development, run tests, or generate documentation, 
you'll need a few more things:

  * RSpec (>= 1.0.5): http://rspec.rubyforge.org/
  * rcov (>= 0.7.0): http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?rcov

If you have RubyGems installed, you can install these automatically via the 
+install_dependencies+ task of the Rakefile:

  $ sudo rake install_dependencies
